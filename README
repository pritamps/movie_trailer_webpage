This folder contains files necessary to generate a movie trailer website from
 a list of movie titles with IMDb information.

To run this project, use the entertainment_center.py as follows:

python entertainment_center.py -f PATH_TO_JSON_FILE

where PATH_TO_JSON_FILE is the path to the json file containing a JSON array
of movie data (see movielist_data.json for an example). If no file is
specified, movielist_data.json itself is used.
